## Download & Install

**[→ Download the latest release](https://github.com/CellPod/bweb/releases/latest)**

Go to the Releases page, scroll down to **Assets**, and pick the file for your system:

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `bWeb-x.x.x-arm64.dmg` |
| macOS (Intel) | `bWeb-x.x.x.dmg` |
| Windows | `bWeb Setup x.x.x.exe` |
| Linux | `bWeb-x.x.x.AppImage` |

No dependencies to install. yt-dlp and ffmpeg are bundled inside the app.

### macOS

1. Download the `.dmg` file
2. Open it and drag bWeb to your Applications folder
3. Open bWeb

bWeb is not code-signed with an Apple certificate, so macOS will block it on first launch. On macOS Sequoia and Sonoma it shows **"bWeb is damaged and can't be opened"** — the app is fine, macOS is just enforcing its quarantine policy.

**To fix it, open Terminal and run:**

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/bWeb.app
```

Then double-click bWeb again — it opens normally from that point on.

> If you haven't moved it to Applications yet, run `xattr -cr` on the `.dmg` file first:
> ```bash
> xattr -cr ~/Downloads/bWeb-*.dmg
> ```

You only need to do this once.

### Windows

1. Download and run the `.exe` installer
2. If SmartScreen appears, click **More info → Run anyway**
3. bWeb installs automatically and creates a shortcut

Installs per-user — no admin required. Uninstall from **Settings → Apps**.

### Linux

1. Download the `.AppImage` file
2. Make it executable: right-click → Properties → Permissions → **Allow executing as program**
3. Double-click to run

## Features

### Download
- **Single video** — Paste a URL, preview the metadata and thumbnail, pick a quality (4K / 2K / 1080p / 720p / 480p or lower), download as MP4 or extract audio as MP3, M4A, OPUS, FLAC, or WAV
- **Playlist** — Paste a playlist URL, select which items to download, pick a format for the whole batch
- **Batch mode** — Paste up to 50 URLs at once, pick a quality preset, add them all to the queue
- **Trim before download** — Set start and end points on the video timeline before adding to queue. Supports multiple segments

### Queue
- Sequential processing with real-time progress per item
- Pause, retry failed, clear done, or cancel all — one failure never stops the rest
- Active download strip always visible at the bottom

### Convert
- Drop any local video or audio file to convert or trim it
- Supports MP4, MKV, MOV, AVI, WebM, MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A, and more
- Trim with a visual timeline before converting

### Account sign-in
- **YouTube** — Sign in to access age-restricted, private, and members-only videos. Your credentials go directly to Google through their standard login page
- **Instagram** — Sign in to download from your saved collections. The app opens Instagram's login page directly — your password is never stored

### Instagram saved collections
yt-dlp doesn't support saved collections natively. bWeb bridges the gap with a built-in scraper:
1. Sign in via **Settings → Instagram Account**
2. Paste a saved collection URL
3. The app opens the page in a hidden browser, scrolls through it, and collects all post links
4. Results appear in a playlist-style picker — select what you want and queue

### Interface
- **French / English** — Full bilingual UI, toggle in Settings
- **6 accent colors** — Blue, Indigo, Purple, Teal, Tomato, Amber — the app logo changes color with your selection
- **Light and dark mode** — Follows your system preference, or force one in Settings
- **Download history** — Quick access to all previously fetched videos with cached metadata

---

## Usage

1. Paste a video or playlist URL and click **Fetch**
2. Pick a quality or audio format
3. Click **Add to Queue**
4. Go to **Queue** and click **Start Queue**

Files are saved to `~/Downloads/bWeb` by default. Change the location in **Settings → Storage**.

You can paste and fetch multiple URLs back-to-back — each result lands in a side panel so you can review and queue them one by one.

---

## Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CellPod/bweb.git
cd bweb
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm install` downloads yt-dlp and ffmpeg automatically for your platform.

### Builds

```bash
npm run build:mac      # macOS — .dmg + .zip
npm run build:win      # Windows — NSIS installer
npm run build:linux    # Linux — AppImage
```

For Apple Silicon:

```bash
npm run build:mac -- --arm64
```

### Cross-platform builds

If you're building for a different architecture, set environment variables before `npm install`:

**Windows (x64) from macOS:**
```bash
export npm_config_platform=win32
export npm_config_arch=x64
rm -rf node_modules bin
npm install
npm run build:win
```

**Linux (x64):**
```bash
export npm_config_platform=linux
export npm_config_arch=x64
rm -rf node_modules bin
npm install
npm run build:linux
```

## Releasing an update

All three platforms auto-update silently in the background via `electron-updater` reading GitHub Releases. The macOS build is **ad-hoc signed** (`scripts/adhoc-sign-mac.js`, run as an electron-builder `afterSign` hook) — a free signature that needs no Apple Developer account. This is enough for Squirrel.Mac (electron-updater's macOS mechanism) to accept and install updates; verified end-to-end (check → download → install → relaunch) with a local test build. It does *not* remove Gatekeeper's "Apple could not verify this app is free of malware" prompt on **first** install — users right-click → Open once to bypass it. Only a paid Developer ID certificate + notarization would remove that one-time prompt; this project doesn't have one.

To ship a new version:

1. Bump `"version"` in `package.json` (e.g. `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`).
2. Export a GitHub token with `repo` scope as `GH_TOKEN`. If the `gh` CLI is already authenticated on this machine (`gh auth status`), reuse its token instead of creating a new one: `export GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)`
3. Build and publish per platform (each uploads the installer **and** the `latest*.yml` file electron-updater checks against):
   ```bash
   npm run release:mac
   npm run release:win     # from macOS via cross-platform build vars above, or from Windows
   npm run release:linux
   ```
   Each command creates/updates a draft GitHub Release tagged `vX.Y.Z` and uploads the artifacts.
4. Publish the draft release on GitHub once all platforms you're shipping are uploaded.

Users get the update automatically within ~3 seconds of their next app launch (downloaded silently, applied on next quit, or immediately if they click "Restart & Update"). They can opt out in Settings → Updates.
